This system is specifically designed to support educational institutions in overseeing and recording students' recitations, **which are mandatory for progressing to internships, seminars, final projects, and other academic activities.** By providing a streamlined platform for tracking these essential recitations, Setoran Hafalan Services simplifies the administrative process, ensuring that all requirements are met efficiently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Before You Begin

Before you start, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the essential components needed to build an Express TypeScript application using Prisma ORM, Bun, and PostgreSQL:

- **Express TypeScript** - Begin with the [Express Official Website](https://expressjs.com/). The [Express TypeScript Guide](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/typescript.html) provides an overview of using Express with TypeScript.
- **Prisma ORM** - Learn about Prisma ORM from the [Prisma Official Website](https://www.prisma.io/). The [Getting Started](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started) guide will help you set up your database schema and integrate Prisma with your application.
- **Bun** - Visit the [Bun Official Website](https://bun.sh/) for information on Bun, a fast JavaScript runtime. Check out the [Getting Started](https://bun.sh/docs/getting-started) guide for installation and usage instructions.
- **PostgreSQL** - Start with the [PostgreSQL Official Website](https://www.postgresql.org/). The [Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) provides comprehensive information on setting up and managing PostgreSQL databases.

## üìù Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:

- **Git** - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git is commonly pre-installed on OSX and Linux machines.
- **Node.js** - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. For installation issues, refer to this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for guidance.
- **Bun** - [Download & Install Bun](https://bun.sh/) for a fast JavaScript runtime environment.

**For Academic Advisors:**

- **Recitation Management:** Monitor and track the progress of students' Quran recitations under their guidance. Review the completeness and accuracy of memorization progress.
- **Approval Process:** Listen to students' offline Quran recitations and assess their memorization progress, then approve or reject the recitations based on your assessment. Provide feedback directly to students to ensure they meet the required standards.

**For Students:**

- **Progress Tracking:** Keep an eye on the status of each recitation you‚Äôve submitted later, monitor your own progress and view updates on the status of your recitations based on feedback from Academic Advisors. Students submit their recitations offline, and no online submission is required.

- **Login:** Users authenticate via Keycloak using their credentials.
- **For Academic Advisors:** Manage and monitor offline recitations, approve or reject submissions based on your evaluation, then provide live feedback to students to help them meet the required memorization standards.
